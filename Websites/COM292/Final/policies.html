				<strong>
				<br />				
					Anti-Hazing
				</strong>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Hazing is contrary to the Creed, standards, ideals, mission and goals of Sigma Pi Fraternity and such activity by our members is hereby prohibited. Sigma Pi Fraternity addresses hazing in the Constitution of Sigma Pi Fraternity under Section 17 of Bylaw 4 and again in Section 5-1 through 5-9 of the FIPG Risk Management Manual.
			</p>
			<p>
				No chapter shall encourage or conduct hazing activities. Hazing activities are defined as:	
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>
					“Any action taken or situation created intentionally, whether on or off fraternity premises, to pro- duce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment or ridicule. Such activities may include but are not limited to the following: use of alcohol, paddling in any form, creation of excessive fatigue, physical and psychological shocks, quests, treasure hunts, scavenger hunts, road trips or any such activities carried on outside or inside the confines of the chapter house, wearing of public apparel which is conspicuous and not normally in good taste, engaging in public stunts and buffoonery, morally degrading or humiliation games and activities, and any other activities which are not consistent with fraternal law, ritual or policy or the regulation and policies of the educational institution.” 
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result of a violation of this section, a Chapter or Colony member is subject to being denied membership into the Fraternity. As a result of a violation of this section a Chapter or Colony of the Fraternity is subject to being suspended and denied a charter, pending reorganization of the Chapter or Colony, in accordance with provision of Article VII, Sections 4 and 7 of the Constitution of the Sigma Pi Fraternity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sigma Pi Fraternity also has a toll free anti-hazing hotline:
				<b>1-888-NOT-HAZE</b> (1-888-668-4293). The line is available to those who think they, or students they know, have become victims of hazing. Callers may remain anonymous or they can provide personal information so that their concerns can be responded to directly. The hotline connects directly to a dedicated voice mailbox at the Cincinnati law firm of Manley Burke, the publisher of Fraternal Law.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<b>Sexual Abuse</b>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Sexual abuse and harassment is contrary to the Creed, standards, ideals, goals and mission of Sigma Pi Fraternity; such activity by our members is hereby expressly prohibited. Sexual abuse is defined by Sigma Pi Fraternity in Bylaw 4, Section 20; and in Section 4-1 through Section 4-7 of the <i>FIPG Risk Management Manual.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				The definition of sexual abuse and/or harassment shall include, but not be limited to, any actions which are demeaning to women and/or men, which including but not limited to, date rape, gang rape, verbal harassment, lewd gestures or offensive touching.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<strong>Anti-Discrimination</strong>
			</h2>
			<p>
				In accordance with the Creed of the Fraternity, no Chapter shall deny membership to an individual meeting the criteria outlined in this article and the academic standards of both the Fraternity and the Chapter’s host institution based on race, color, ethnicity, country of origin, sexual orientation, religion or disability.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<b>Alcohol policy</b>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Alcohol abuse is contradictory to the Creed, standards, ideals, mission and goals of Sigma Pi Fraternity and such activity by our members is hereby strictly prohibited. Each Chapter or Colony should do its utmost to prevent such abuse and to help any member who has a challenge in this regard. Alcohol is addressed in both Bylaw 4, Section 4 of the Bylaws of Sigma Pi, as well as in the <i>FIPG Risk Management Manual.</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Sigma Pi Fraternity defines alcohol abuse to include the excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages by initiated members or new members of the Fraternity to the extent that their mental or physical facilities, or both, are appreciably impaired, and in violation of applicable laws or laws of subordinate governing bodies to applicable college or university regulations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Each member and new member will be instructed on drinking age, regulation of sales, open container and other laws pertinent to the Chapter’s or Colony’s jurisdiction, specifically dram shop liability, implied consent, and host liquor liability. Instruction shall also be provided with the goal of fostering in each member a sense of responsibility toward the welfare of those who consume alcohol, the encouragement of intervention to prevent any person from drinking to excess, or from engaging in any potentially dangerous activity, including driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Instruction shall also be provided on emergency procedures to be employed as a result of alcohol abuse. Educational programs on alcohol awareness shall be held on annually. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Any legal use of alcoholic beverages shall be made in a responsible manner. The responsible use of alcohol does not include providing unlimited quantities, encouraging rapid consumption or forcing any person to consume alcohol for any reason. The possession use and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages while at an official fraternity event, or in any situation sponsored or endorsed by the chapter, must be in compliance with any and all applicable laws of state, province, country, city, and institution of higher education. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result of a violation of this section, a Chapter or Colony of the Fraternity is subject to disciplinary action by the Grand Council in accordance with the severity and circumstances of the violation. If the review of the violation by the Grand Council so indicates a Chapter or Colony may be suspended and denied a charter, pending reorganization of the Chapter or Colony, in accordance with the provisions of Article VII, Section 5, of the Constitution of the Fraternity.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<b>Transgender Policy</b>
			</h2>
			<p>
				With regard to Article III, Membership, of the Constitution of Sigma Pi Fraternity, International, it is the policy and interpretation of the Grand Council of the Fraternity that an individual is eligible for membership only if he is both legally and physically male at the time of pledging and initiation.  For purposes of this policy, the term “legally” is defined as being eligible to be and actually labeled as male on any state- or federal-issued identification.  For purposes of this policy, the term “physically” is defined as being physiologically, as opposed to only psychologically, male.
